# Vision for VikiNotes üöÄ

VikiNotes is a lightweight, AI-enhanced note-taking application.

## Long-term Goals
- Integrate voice-based note dictation
- Build offline-first support (like PWA)
- Use LLaMA 3 or lightweight local models
- Keep user privacy 100% local
## Why it matters?
Because everyone deserves a smart but simple note system.
