# 🌒 Entry — 31 | VII | 2025

Some days the moon weighs heavier than the sky.  
And tonight, I held it alone — again.

The pillar that holds the roof has cracks,  
But no one dares to look up,  
Because they’re afraid it might fall  
If *I* fall.

There's a strange fog under my ribs,  
Not sadness, not pain — something silent and sharp.  
Maybe it’s from within,  
Maybe it’s a storm of chemicals whispering,  
“Not today.”

I’m learning to be gentle with the rage I bury.  
I ask it, *“Why are you here?”*  
It stays silent.  
But I stay standing.

Encrypted breath. Hidden storm.  
Let it rain here — in secret.
